Q1: What kind of data was compromised? (identify PII)
PII (Personally Identifiable Information) refers to any data that can uniquely identify an individual.

In this breach, all of the following are PII:

Names → directly identify a person

Phone numbers → linked to personal identity

Aadhaar numbers → a highly sensitive government-issued identifier in India

Bank account details → linked to a person’s financial identity and very sensitive

So, the data compromised was highly sensitive PII, with a combination of:
✅ personal identifiers (name, phone)
✅ government identifiers (Aadhaar)
✅ financial identifiers (bank details)

This is a major privacy violation under India’s DPDP Act, and also high risk for fraud and identity theft.

Q2: How could this incident have been prevented?
The root cause is a misconfigured AWS bucket — one of the most common cloud security mistakes.

The breach could have been prevented by following cloud security best practices:

✅ Proper access control

Enforce least-privilege permissions on cloud buckets

Use IAM (Identity and Access Management) roles to grant only what is absolutely necessary

✅ Disable public access

By default, S3 buckets should be private

Public read/write access must be explicitly reviewed and approved

✅ Encryption

Encrypt data in the bucket at rest (e.g., SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)

Always use HTTPS (TLS) for data in transit

✅ Misconfiguration monitoring

Use AWS Config, AWS Trusted Advisor, or third-party cloud security posture management tools to scan for misconfigured storage

Set up alerts for any policy violations

✅ Security audits

Periodic penetration testing of cloud assets

Vulnerability scanning of all public-facing resources

✅ Logging and monitoring

Enable CloudTrail logs

Monitor who is accessing what, when, and from where

In short:

The incident was fully preventable by correctly configuring cloud permissions, auditing regularly, and encrypting data.

Q3: What are the immediate and long-term measures the company must take?
✅ Immediate Measures

1️⃣ Contain the breach

Immediately revoke public access to the S3 bucket

Rotate all exposed bank accounts’ and credentials’ secrets (API keys, access keys, passwords)

Notify impacted customers as required by law

Report to relevant authorities (e.g., CERT-In, DPDP authority in India)

2️⃣ Perform a forensic investigation

Determine if the attackers copied or modified data

Check for further compromise beyond the S3 bucket

3️⃣ Implement emergency security fixes

Patch any gaps in IAM policies

Enable encryption on all buckets

Review AWS permissions top-to-bottom

✅ Long-Term Measures

1️⃣ Develop a cloud security policy

Formalize security guidelines for cloud resource configurations

Include mandatory reviews before making resources public

2️⃣ Regular audits & vulnerability assessments

Schedule third-party security assessments of cloud infrastructure at least annually

Automate misconfiguration checks

3️⃣ Adopt a privacy-by-design approach

Build security controls directly into application and infrastructure design

Minimize data collection and retention to only what is necessary

4️⃣ Train employees

Security awareness training for developers and DevOps

Specific training on secure cloud configuration

5️⃣ Data protection practices

Tokenize or encrypt PII data as an additional safeguard

Use secure vaults for sensitive keys

6️⃣ Incident Response Readiness

Establish an IR plan with clear responsibilities

Run breach simulation exercises to stay prepared

7️⃣ Compliance alignment

Follow India’s Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act

Implement data classification and data retention policies

Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) if needed
