1Ô∏è‚É£ What are the cybersecurity principles violated here (CIA Triad)?
The CIA Triad is the foundation of cybersecurity:

C ‚Äì Confidentiality
Protects information from unauthorized access.
‚Üí Violated because the attackers have gained access to sensitive patient records and could potentially leak them.

I ‚Äì Integrity
Protects data from unauthorized modification or destruction.
‚Üí Violated since ransomware encrypts or alters files, making them unusable and potentially corrupted.

A ‚Äì Availability
Ensures authorized users have reliable access to data and systems when needed.
‚Üí Severely violated because patient records are locked, surgeries are delayed or canceled, risking lives.

In summary:
All three pillars of the CIA triad were broken:

Confidentiality: patient data exposed to attackers

Integrity: data altered/encrypted

Availability: data and systems unavailable for critical patient care

2Ô∏è‚É£ How could PII and CII be involved in this situation?
‚úÖ PII (Personally Identifiable Information):

Hospitals store names, addresses, contact details, medical histories, test results, even insurance information.

All of these qualify as PII under privacy laws (e.g., India‚Äôs DPDP Act, HIPAA in the US).

If attackers exfiltrate and threaten to leak these records, patient privacy is catastrophically compromised.

‚úÖ CII (Critical Information Infrastructure):

A modern hospital depends on digital systems for:

patient admissions

ICU/OT equipment

pharmacy systems

lab diagnostics

remote consultations

These systems are vital to public health and safety. Their disruption could endanger lives, making them part of Critical Information Infrastructure under Section 70 of the IT Act.

Hence:
üëâ PII is impacted through patient data compromise
üëâ CII is impacted through loss of essential healthcare services

3Ô∏è‚É£ Propose a cybersecurity framework the hospital should adopt going forward
A hospital needs a structured cybersecurity framework with a holistic approach. A well-suited framework would include:

‚úÖ NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
This is globally recognized and practical, with five pillars:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Identify

Maintain a full asset inventory (devices, servers, medical equipment)

Identify critical processes (e.g., ICU systems, EMR ‚Äî electronic medical records)

Perform regular risk assessments

2Ô∏è‚É£ Protect

Enforce strong access controls and multi-factor authentication

Network segmentation (separate hospital admin systems from medical devices)

Employee awareness and phishing training

Robust backup strategy (offline/immutable backups)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Detect

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) to detect suspicious activity

Endpoint detection and response (EDR) on all devices

Intrusion detection systems (IDS)

24x7 monitoring, possibly with a Security Operations Center (SOC)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Respond

A well-tested incident response plan

Pre-defined ransomware playbooks

Coordination with national cyber agencies (like CERT-In in India)

Ensure legal, regulatory, and media communication plans are in place

5Ô∏è‚É£ Recover

Well-defined data recovery procedures

Periodic drills to test data restoration

Post-incident reviews to learn and improve

Other important additions:

‚úÖ Zero-Trust Architecture

Always verify identity

Least privilege for every user

Micro-segmentation of the network

‚úÖ Regular vulnerability assessments & penetration testing

Hospitals often have outdated medical devices ‚Äî they need to be continuously tested.

‚úÖ Data encryption

Encrypt data at rest and in transit

So even if stolen, it remains unreadable

‚úÖ Third-party risk management

Many hospitals work with outsourced labs, insurance partners ‚Äî all should follow robust security practices.

‚úÖ Comply with applicable laws

In India, Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act

In the US, HIPAA

Ensure the hospital‚Äôs policies match these legal requirements
